Electronegative LDL (LDL(-)) is a plasma LDL subfraction inducing induces cytokine release in monocytes by activating TLR4. The subsequent phosphorylation of p38 MAPK phosphorylation (which is higher compared to native LDL) through TLR4 and PI3k/Akt pathways activates NF-kB, AP-1 and CREB. These last three have a direct effect on four cytokines (IL1beta, IL6, IL10 and MCP1), with bold black letters for the highest level of cytokine induction, gray letters for the lowest level and regular letter for the intermediate induction.
